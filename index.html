            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Altschool ID: ALT/SOE/024/0957</p>
            <p>My name is Jacinth David. I am a 23 year old graduate of Covenant University where studied Electrical Electronics Engineering.I was born on March 28, 2001, emerging as the firstborn of four siblings, a position that has shaped my leadership skills and creative drive from an early age. Growing up in a bustling household, I quickly learned the art of self-expression, finding my voice through various artistic mediums. My passion for creation manifested initially through drawing and sketching, but it wasn't until I discovered 2D animation that I truly found my calling.My journey in animation began as a hobby during my teenage years, experimenting with simple software and creating short clips that caught the attention of friends and family. As I honed my skills, my unique style began to emerge â€“ a blend of vibrant colors, fluid movements, and storytelling that spoke to my Nigerian heritage and contemporary influences. This dedication to my craft eventually led to collaborations with notable figures in the Nigerian music and entertainment industry. My work with Victony, known for his Afro-fusion sound, involved creating animated music videos that perfectly captured the essence of his music.<br>
            The collaboration with Korty, a prominent content creator, saw me developing animated intros and transitions for her YouTube channel, adding a distinctive flair to her already popular content. My animations for Azanti helped visualize his musical narratives, while my work with Wonu Osikoya brought her vision for Afrobeats storytelling to life in animated form.These projects not only showcased my talent but also exposed me to the business side of creative work, planting the seeds for my future entrepreneurial endeavors. As my reputation grew, so did my ambition to push the boundaries of my craft.In 2023, a pivotal year in my career, I made the bold decision to expand my skill set into the realm of software development. This move was driven by a desire to understand the technical backbone of the digital tools I used daily in my animation work.
